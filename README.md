# Abstract

Sentiments analysis is a data mining technique that is used to measure and understand people's opinion and inclination through NLP(Natural Language Processing). 
Computational linguistics and text analysis are used to analyze the infromation.

The most popular word embedding algorithms are Google's Word2Vec, Stanford's GloVe.
In this we use the famous TensorFlow library to create a model to identify an intent behind a piece of text which in this case is a movie review on IMDb a popular online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content.
